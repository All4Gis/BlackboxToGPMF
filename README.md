Here are a bunch of scripts that I created some time ago as a _proof of concept_
that Betaflight blackbox _gyro_ data can be converted to GoPro Metadata Format (GPMF) and
embedded into a MP4 file that is shot with _non_-GoPro camera.

The goal of this is that the file thus produced can be used in [ReelSteady GO](https://www.reelsteady.com/pages/go-details)
to achieve image stabilization (similar to GoPro HyperSmooth functionality).

There is a discussion [here](https://github.com/ElvinC/gyroflow/issues/1) which gives some basic idea
how the scripts can be used.

These scripts are _not_ a finished product and if one wants to use them he'll have to dig
in and _modify_ them according to his needs.

Currently I don't plan to develop this project any further but I'm placing it here
so that anyone who finds it interesting can base his own work on it.
